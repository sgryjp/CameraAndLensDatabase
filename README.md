# CameraAndLensDatabase

Database of interchangeable-lens cameras and lenses.

This repository provides two CSV files, [cameras.csv](cameras.csv) and
[lenses.csv](lenses.csv). Note that currently they contain minimal information
just enough to calculate depth-of-field. This is because the database was made
for my [DoF Table][dof-table] app, which is a depth-of-field calculator.

If you notice there are models not in the database, please let me know by
creating an issue.
